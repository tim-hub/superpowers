# Writing Plans

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — Read Before Anything Else

**You MUST NOT call `EnterPlanMode` or `ExitPlanMode` at any point during this skill.** This skill operates in normal mode and manages its own completion flow via `AskUserQuestion`. Calling `EnterPlanMode` traps the session in plan mode where Write/Edit are restricted. Calling `ExitPlanMode` breaks the workflow and skips the user's execution choice. If you feel the urge to call either, STOP — follow this skill's instructions instead.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## REQUIRED FIRST STEP: Initialize Task Tracking

**BEFORE exploring code or writing the plan, you MUST:**

1. Call `TaskList` to check for existing tasks from brainstorming
2. If tasks exist: you will enhance them with implementation details as you write the plan
3. If no tasks: you will create them with `TaskCreate` as you write each plan task

**Do not proceed to exploration until TaskList has been called.**

```
TaskList
```

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers-extended-cc:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Handoff: Choose How to Proceed

<HARD-GATE>
STOP. You are about to complete the plan. DO NOT call EnterPlanMode or ExitPlanMode. You MUST call AskUserQuestion below. Both are FORBIDDEN — EnterPlanMode traps the session, ExitPlanMode skips the user's execution choice.
</HARD-GATE>

Your ONLY permitted next action is calling `AskUserQuestion` with this EXACT structure:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Plan saved. How should we proceed?"
  header: "Proceed"
  options:
    - label: "Subagent-Driven (this session)"
      description: "I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration"
    - label: "Separate Session (new terminal)"
      description: "Open new session in worktree, batch processing with checkpoints"
```

**If you are about to call ExitPlanMode, STOP — call AskUserQuestion instead.**

<HOOK-SAFETY>
Stop hooks scan your prose for patterns like `execute.*plan`, `implement.*plan`, and `rollout.*plan`. If matched, the hook forces immediate in-session work — overriding the user's choice. To avoid false triggers:
- Use "run", "work through", "proceed with", or "follow" — NEVER "execute", "implement", or "rollout" near the word "plan"
- When referencing the skill path, put it inside a fenced code block with NO surrounding prose combining those words with "plan"
- Example SAFE: "In the new session, run:" followed by a code block containing the skill invocation
- Example UNSAFE: "To execute this plan, open a new session" — matches `execute.*plan`
</HOOK-SAFETY>

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers-extended-cc:subagent-driven-development
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review

**If Separate Session chosen:**
- Provide the commands to open a new session in the worktree
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** The new session uses superpowers-extended-cc:executing-plans
- Format your response as numbered steps with code blocks only — keep prose minimal
- Do NOT write phrases combining "execute/implement/run" with "plan" in your prose (see HOOK-SAFETY above)

## Native Task Integration Reference

Use Claude Code's native task tools (v2.1.16+) to create structured tasks alongside the plan document.

### Creating Native Tasks

For each task in the plan, create a corresponding native task:

```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Task N: [Component Name]"
  description: |
    [Copy the full task content from the plan you just wrote — files, steps, acceptance criteria, everything]
  activeForm: "Implementing [Component Name]"
```

### Setting Dependencies

After all tasks created, set blockedBy relationships:

```
TaskUpdate:
  taskId: [task-id]
  addBlockedBy: [prerequisite-task-ids]
```

### During Execution

Update task status as work progresses:

```
TaskUpdate:
  taskId: [task-id]
  status: in_progress  # when starting

TaskUpdate:
  taskId: [task-id]
  status: completed    # when done
```

### Notes

- Native tasks provide CLI-visible progress tracking
- Plan document remains the permanent record

---

## Task Persistence

At plan completion, write the task persistence file **in the same directory as the plan document**.

If the plan is saved to `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feature.md`, the tasks file MUST be saved to `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feature.md.tasks.json`.

```json
{
  "planPath": "docs/plans/2026-01-15-feature.md",
  "tasks": [
    {"id": 0, "subject": "Task 0: ...", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": 1, "subject": "Task 1: ...", "status": "pending", "blockedBy": [0]}
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "<timestamp>"
}
```

Both the plan `.md` and `.tasks.json` must be co-located in `docs/plans/`.

### Resuming Work

Any new session can resume by running:
```
/superpowers-extended-cc:executing-plans <plan-path>
```

The skill reads the `.tasks.json` file and continues from where it left off.
