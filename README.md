# Superpowers Extended CC (Personal Fork)

Personal fork of [pcvelz/superpowers](https://github.com/pcvelz/superpowers) (itself a fork of [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)) with opinionated workflow customizations.

## What This Fork Changes

This fork enforces a specific development workflow on top of the upstream superpowers-extended-cc plugin. All changes are in-place modifications to existing skill files.

### Workflow Customizations

| Customization | Skill Modified | What It Does |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Brainstorming re-trigger | `using-superpowers` | Re-invokes brainstorming mid-conversation for any new non-trivial ask, with bias toward triggering |
| Adversarial spec review | `brainstorming` | After spec self-review, dispatches two opus subagents (advocate + challenger) to adversarially review the spec |
| Adversarial plan review | `writing-plans` | Same advocate/challenger pattern applied to implementation plans |
| Mandatory TDD | `writing-plans` | All code-producing tasks must specify tests-first ordering. No exceptions for code. Skill edits, config, and docs are excluded. |
| Auto-select subagent-driven | `writing-plans` | Removes the user choice between subagent-driven and parallel session. Always uses subagent-driven development. |
| Opus-only subagents | `subagent-driven-development` | All subagents use opus. Replaces the tiered cheap/standard/capable model selection. |
| Mandatory code review | `subagent-driven-development` | Final code review is mandatory with a HARD-GATE. All findings must be addressed before proceeding. |
| Mandatory finishing branch | `subagent-driven-development` | Must invoke finishing-a-development-branch before any push or PR. WIP pushes allowed when explicitly requested. |

### Removed from Upstream

- `.github/` directory (issue templates, PR template, funding config)
- `scripts/bump-version.sh`

## Installation

```bash
# Register marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add tim-hub/superpowers

# Install plugin
claude plugin install spower@spower
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude plugin list
```

You should see `spower@spower-marketplace` listed and enabled.

## The Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines ideas through questions, explores alternatives, validates design in sections. Runs adversarial spec review (advocate + challenger) before user review. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into TDD-structured tasks. Runs adversarial plan review. Auto-invokes subagent-driven development.

4. **subagent-driven-development** - Dispatches fresh opus subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality). Mandatory final code review before finishing.

5. **test-driven-development** - Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR within every code-producing task. Tests written and verified failing before any implementation.

6. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Mandatory before any push or PR. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Non-trivial mid-conversation asks re-trigger brainstorming.

## How Native Tasks Work

When `writing-plans` creates tasks, each task carries structured metadata that survives across sessions and subagent dispatch:

```yaml
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Task 1: Add price validation to optimizer"
  description: |
    **Goal:** Validate input prices before optimization runs.

    **Files:**
    - Modify: `src/optimizer.py:45-60`
    - Create: `tests/test_price_validation.py`

    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] Negative prices raise ValueError
    - [ ] Empty price list raises ValueError
    - [ ] Valid prices pass through unchanged

    **Verify:** `pytest tests/test_price_validation.py -v`

    ```json:metadata
    {"files": ["src/optimizer.py", "tests/test_price_validation.py"],
     "verifyCommand": "pytest tests/test_price_validation.py -v",
     "acceptanceCriteria": ["Negative prices raise ValueError",
       "Empty price list raises ValueError",
       "Valid prices pass through unchanged"]}
    ```
```

The `json:metadata` block is embedded in the description because `TaskGet` returns the description but not the `metadata` parameter. This ensures metadata is always available — for `executing-plans` verification, `subagent-driven-development` dispatch, and `.tasks.json` cross-session resume.

## What's Inside

### Skills Library

**Testing**
- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle (includes testing anti-patterns reference)

**Debugging**
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)
- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed

**Collaboration**
- **brainstorming** - Socratic design refinement + *native task creation*
- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans + *native task dependencies*
- **executing-plans** - Batch execution with checkpoints
- **dispatching-parallel-agents** - Concurrent subagent workflows
- **requesting-code-review** - Pre-review checklist
- **receiving-code-review** - Responding to feedback
- **using-git-worktrees** - Parallel development branches
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Merge/PR decision workflow
- **subagent-driven-development** - Fast iteration with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)

**Meta**
- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)
- **using-superpowers** - Introduction to the skills system

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing
- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal
- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success

## Recommended Configuration

### Disable Auto Plan Mode

Claude Code may automatically enter Plan mode during planning tasks, which conflicts with the structured skill workflows in this plugin. To prevent this, add `EnterPlanMode` to your permission deny list.

**In your project's `.claude/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["EnterPlanMode"]
  }
}
```

This blocks the model from calling `EnterPlanMode`, ensuring the brainstorming and writing-plans skills operate correctly in normal mode. See [upstream discussion](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23384) for context.

### Block Commits With Incomplete Tasks

Optional `PreToolUse` hook that blocks `git commit` while a native task is `in_progress`. Pending tasks pass through, so per-task commit flows work as intended.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/spower-marketplace/hooks/examples/pre-commit-check-tasks.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/pre-commit-check-tasks.sh` for how it parses the session transcript and which task states count as open.

### Block Low-Context Stop Excuses

Optional `Stop`-event hook that blocks "fresh session later" / "context is full" deflections when real context usage is below 50%.

Opt in via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/spower-marketplace/hooks/examples/stop-deflection-guard.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the header of `hooks/examples/stop-deflection-guard.sh` for the full list of blocked phrases, configuration environment variables, and fail-open behavior.
